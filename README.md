# Elm word search grid generator

Small Elm app to generate printable Word search game grids. Currently only in english. Here's the [live version]().

## Development

First of all you need the Elm compiler installed, please refer to the [Elm installation guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) for further info.

Once installed I recommend you to get [Elm live](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html), it's a great tool to get a dev server with live reloading going in no time.

```bash
elm-live ./src/Main.elm --start-page index.html -- --output=elm.js
```
